    <h1>Broccoli Cheddar Soup</h1>
    <img src='../images/soup.jpg' alt='Some gourds in a garden' width='310'>
    <h2>Description</h2> 
    <p>
      I have some veggie water, some corn, and some potatoes I'd like to make a chowder-like soup for. This looks like it will fill the bill.
    </p>
		<p>
		  I got it from my Troy Farm mailer. 
		</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
		  <li>1 Tbsp butter</li>
      <li>1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
			<li>1/4 cup salted butter</li>
			<li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
			<li>2 cups chicken broth or vegetable broth</li>
			<li>2 cups half and half</li>
			<li>12 oz fresh broccoli (I use a 12 oz bag of florets) , roughly chopped</li>
			<li>2 carrots, peeled and chopped</li>
			<li>1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
			<li>1/4 tsp paprika</li>
			<li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
			<li>1/4 tsp dry mustard (can substitute with about 1/2 tsp regular mustard)</li>
			<li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
			<li>2 cups cheddar cheese</li>
		</ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
		<ol>
		  <li>Add 1 Tbsp butter to dutch oven and heat over MED heat.  Add chopped onion and saute until onions are soft and translucent, about 2-3 minutes.  Add 1/4 cup butter to dutch oven, still over MED heat. When melted, add flour and whisk together. Cook mixture for about 1 minute, whisking often.</li>

      <li>Slowly pour in about a cup of chicken broth, whisking as you pour.  Continue with remaining chicken broth and half and half, pouring slowly and whisking as you pour.
Let broth/half and half mixture cook for a minute or two, whisking often, making sure no flour lumps remain.</li>

			<li>Add broccoli and carrots and stir to combine.  Add paprika, garlic powder, dry mustard, salt and pepper, stir.  Reduce heat to LOW/MED LOW and simmer for about 10-15 minutes or until thickened, and broccoli/carrots are fork tender.  If the soup gets too thick for your liking, add a splash of chicken broth or half and half to loosen it up.</li>

			<li>Blend soup until desired texture is reached, using either immersion blender or by transferring soup to a traditional blender.</li>

			<li>Add grated cheddar cheese a handful at a time, stirring to melt the cheese into the soup after each handful.  Taste soup and season with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>

			<li>Serve hot with additional black pepper and shredded cheese on top if desired.</li>
		</ol>
