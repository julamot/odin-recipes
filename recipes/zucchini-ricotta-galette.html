    <h2>Description</h2> 
    <p>
      One last recipe from Troy Farms. I love pastry dough in anything.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<h3>For the galette crust<h3>
		<ul>
		  <li>1¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
			<li>¼ teaspoon Kosher or fine sea salt</li>
			<li>½ cup unsalted butter, cold and cut into cubes</li>
			<li>3 tablespoon ice water, plus more if needed</li>
			<li>1 egg yolk plus 1 teaspoon water for an egg wash</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>For the filling<h3>
		<ul>
		  <li>1 large (about 9 ounces) zucchini, sliced into thin rounds (about ⅛-¼ inch thick) and patted dry with a paper towel, about 2 cups sliced zucchini</li>
		  <li>¾ cup ricotta cheese</li>
		  <li>½ cup grated pecorino romano cheese</li>
		  <li>2 tablespoon olive oil, divided</li>
		  <li>¾ tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary</li>
		  <li>2 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
		  <li>½ teaspoon Kosher or fine sea salt, plus more to taste</li>
		  <li>½ tsp fresh ground black pepper, plus more to taste</li>
		</ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
		<h3>Make the crust:</h3>
		<ol>
		  <li>Pulse the flour, sugar and salt in a food processor to blend. Add butter and pulse 5-6 more times until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>

      <li>Add 3 tablespoons ice water, and pulse well after each addition. Add just enough water to make a crumbly dough (I usually need about 5 tablespoons total). The dough will look like wet sand, it will not come together on its own but it will take shape when mixed with your hands.</li>

			<li>Roll the dough into a ball onto a lightly floured surface, and then flatten it into a disk. Chill the dough in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes. While the crust is chilling, prepare your filling.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Prepare the filling and assemble the galette:</h3>
		<ol>
		  <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
			<li>Mix the ricotta, grated cheese, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, rosemary, lemon zest, salt, and pepper in a bowl and set aside.</li>
			<li>Remove the dough disk from the refrigerator. Roll the dough onto a lightly floured surface to about 12 inches in diameter.</li>
			<li>Place the ricotta mixture in the center of the galette, leaving about a 1½-inch border around the edges. Use the back of a spoon to evenly distribute the filling.</li>
			<li>Place the zucchini in the center, covering the filling. I like to overlap the zucchini slices in circles for a prettier presentation.</li>
			<li>Fold the galette border over the filling, pleating the edges as you work around it. The goal here is sloppy rustic, no need for perfection!</li>
			<li>Drizzle the remaining tablespoon of olive oil over the zucchini and season with additional salt and pepper.</li>
			<li>Prepare the egg wash: In a small bowl, beat together the egg yolk and 1 teaspoon of water. Brush the edges of the crust with the egg wash.</li>
			<li>Transfer the prepared galette to the parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake for 30-40 minutes until the edges are golden brown.</li>
			<li>Cut into wedges and serve warm or at room temperature with additional cheese, rosemary, or fresh lemon zest sprinkled on top.</li>
